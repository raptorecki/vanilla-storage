# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.22] - 2025-09-10

### Added
- `scan_drive.php`: Added functionality to collect and store drive recovery data.
- `disk_recovery.php`: New file containing functions for collecting drive recovery data.

### Changed
- `scan_drive.php`: Now calls the `collect_recovery_data` function from `disk_recovery.php` to store recovery information.

### Changed
- `scan_drive.php`: Improved debug output verbosity. When run with the `--debug` flag, the script now provides detailed, step-by-step logging for all major operations within the file processing loop, including metadata extraction, hashing, database operations, and thumbnail generation.

## [1.1.20] - 2025-09-10

### Fixed
- `scan_drive.php`: The script no longer crashes when trying to create a thumbnail for a malformed image (e.g., an image with a height of 1px that results in a calculated thumbnail height of 0px). It now skips creating a thumbnail for such files and logs the issue.

## [1.1.19] - 2025-09-10

### Fixed
- `scan_drive.php`: Fixed a bug where the script would crash on filenames with special characters (e.g., containing `!`, `(`, `)`, `'`) or non-ASCII characters. The `ExiftoolManager` now correctly handles such filenames by specifying the UTF-8 charset.

## [1.1.18] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed
- `scan_drive.php`: Corrected a bug where the final scan summary would incorrectly display all zeros. The script now reliably shows the final statistics by using in-memory data for the report and consolidating final database updates into a single query.

## [1.1.17] - 2025-09-07

### Changed
- `drives.php`: "Used/Free" column now displays "DEAD" for dead drives and "ONLINE" for online drives.
- `stats.php`: Excluded dead and online drives from "Drives With Scan Required" section.
- `style.css`: Added `dead-bar` and `online-bar` CSS classes for visual representation of drive status.

## [1.1.16] - 2025-09-07

### Added
- `browse.php`: Added debug output for path variables when debug mode is enabled.

### Changed
- `browse.php`: Changed "‚Üê Back to Home/Search" link to point to `drives.php`.

## [1.1.15] - 2025-09-07

### Fixed
- `browse.php`: Corrected SQL query for root directory browsing to properly display directories and files.
- `browse.php`: Resolved PHP parse error on line 122 by ensuring the SQL query string is correctly terminated.

## [1.1.14] - 2025-09-07

### Fixed
- `browse.php`: Standardized path handling in SQL queries to consistently expect paths with a leading slash, improving display reliability.
- `scan_drive.php`: Ensured all stored file paths in the `st_files` table consistently start with a leading slash, resolving inconsistencies.
- Addressed minor code style and HTML entity encoding issues in `browse.php`.

## [1.1.13] - 2025-09-07

### Changed
- `scan_drive.php`: Modified `exiftool_json` storage format to consistently store data as a JSON array, aligning with `exiftool`'s default output and improving compatibility with existing data.

## [1.1.12] - 2025-09-07

### Changed
- Bumped `app_version` to 1.1.12.

## [1.1.11] - 2025-08-24

### Changed
- `scan_drive.php` improvements:
    - Optimized database commit frequency using a time-based strategy with a count-based fallback.

## [1.1.10] - 2025-09-06

### Changed
- Bumped `app_version` to 1.1.10.

### Fixed
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Improved `ExiftoolManager` resource management to prevent leaks by ensuring proper process cleanup during script termination.
  - Enhanced error recovery in the file processing loop, introducing exponential backoff and broader detection of filesystem errors (e.g., 'Permission denied', 'Input/output error').
  - Improved error handling and removed `@` suppressions for critical operations like `getimagesize`, `exif_read_data`, and `shell_exec` for `ffprobe` and `file` commands, ensuring better error context and preventing silent failures.

## [1.1.9] - 2025-09-06

### Added
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Introduced `--safe-delay` command-line option to add a configurable delay (in microseconds) between I/O operations (exiftool, file command, MD5 hash calculation, thumbnail generation). This helps prevent I/O overload and server crashes on slower drives or USB connections.
  - Added `safe_delay_us` configuration option to `config.php.example` to set a default delay value.

## [1.1.8] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Corrected a variable scope issue in the `signal_handler` to ensure interruptions are reliably detected.
  - Refactored the shutdown handler to consistently use `GLOBALS` for accessing shared state, making it more robust.

### Removed
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Removed the unused `$commitInterval` variable.

## [1.1.7] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Corrected a flaw in command-line argument parsing that caused flags like `--no-filetype` and `--no-exif` to be ignored.
  - Hardened the script by adding validation for the `memory_limit` value in the config.
  - Improved handling of `--help` and `--version` flags to ensure they are processed correctly.
  - Fixed a potential notice by initializing the `$GLOBALS['current_scanned_path']` variable.
  - Added a more explicit check for the `--no-exif` flag in the metadata extraction logic.
  - Removed conflicting logic for the `--use-external-thumb-gen` flag to prevent unintended side effects.

## [1.1.6] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Corrected an issue where using multiple command-line options at once would fail.
  - Hardened argument parsing to enforce that options (e.g., `--no-exif`) must come before positional arguments (`drive_id`, etc.).
  - The script will now exit with an error if an unknown option is used.

## [1.1.5] - 2025-09-06

### Changed
- **Scan Script (`scan_drive.php`):**
  - Implemented `ExiftoolManager` to use a persistent `exiftool` process (`-stay_open` flag), significantly reducing overhead when extracting metadata from a large number of files. This avoids repeatedly launching the `exiftool` executable for each file.

## [1.1.4] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- **PowerShell Scan Script (`scan_drive.ps1`):**
  - Corrected `md5_hash` assignment within `PSCustomObject` by using a subexpression `$(...)` for conditional logic, resolving "The term 'if' is not recognized" error.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- **PowerShell Scan Script (`scan_drive.ps1`):**
  - Added robust checks for null or empty ExifTool and FFprobe data to prevent "Cannot index into a null array" errors during metadata processing.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- **PowerShell Scan Script (`scan_drive.ps1`):**
  - Ensured robust CSV output by explicitly casting all relevant fields to string, resolving `System.Object[]` display issues for `file_category`, `filetype`, and other metadata fields.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- **PowerShell Scan Script (`scan_drive.ps1`):**
  - Resolved `System.Object[]` error in CSV output by robustly handling file categorization.
  - Corrected `filetype` parsing to accurately extract description from `fil` command output.
  - Eliminated leading garbage lines in CSV by fixing header generation.
  - Improved drive detection reliability and added Administrator check.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-26

### Added
- **External Scanning System:** Introduced a new system for scanning drives on external Windows machines.
  - Created a PowerShell script (`scan_drive.ps1`) to perform comprehensive, read-only scans and generate `.csv` (file data) and `.ini` (drive metadata) files.
  - Added a new "Import" page (`import_csv.php`) to the application for uploading these scan files.
  - The import page features a target drive selector with a serial number mismatch check for safety.
- **Documentation:** Added `README_EXTERNAL.md` with detailed instructions for the new external scanning feature.

### Changed

## [1.0.17] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Corrected `rowCount()` logic in `scan_drive.php` for `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` to accurately track added/updated files and ensure correct `fileId` retrieval for thumbnail generation.

## [1.0.16] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- Removed ETA calculation from `scan_drive.php` to prevent server crashes.

## [1.0.15] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed

- Added a warning for when the `pcntl` extension is not loaded, making signal handling behavior more transparent.
- Enhanced the `--bypass-eta` flag to provide a simple progress indicator (items and size scanned) instead of disabling all progress feedback.
